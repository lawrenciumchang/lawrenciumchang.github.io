However, as I was browsing different products, I found small bits and pieces that I felt could be improved. Although I wasn’t in any position where I could implement A/B tests for Adidas, I decided to entertain the idea from a design stance. Some changes I made included layout spacing, decluttering of excess information, and surfacing more relevant product information.",
