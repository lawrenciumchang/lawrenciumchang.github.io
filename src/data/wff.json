Over the months leading up to this project, members voiced challenges of finding and registering for events, building ongoing relationships through the organization, and locating a central repository of resources to help develop their career. I stepped in to lead the effort in designing a solution that addressed these concerns.\nThe organization started with a large list of requirements -- all needs and wants from members of the organization and partners who helped sponsor events. My first challenge was to cut through all the noise and to really understand what was feasible and appropriate to build in our timeframe of eight months. Along the way, I conducted interviews with stakeholders, partners, and members to identify key themes. All of this discovery and planning culminated in a sitemap that underwent several revisions. It was this document that helped align the team on what we were building, who we were building it for, and how we would define success."

Our defining question in this session was to understand how we could build a product that would entice users to revisit the site on an ongoing basis. The focus of this activity was rooted in the landing page of this application. Through this activity, we uncovered many sources of inspiration, understood how information was perceived by different audiences, and defined a structure to where content would live on the site. Although this design sprint only addressed a sliver of the work we were doing, it served as a starting point and foundation for the rest of the project."
