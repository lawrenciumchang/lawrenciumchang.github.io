            <p class="h5">Hitting the shutter is only half the job. Perfecting the edit shows how you see the world through your eyes.</p>

        <p class="h5">I always found it facinating how photographers would choose to edit their photos. So I decided to create The Image Project.</p>
        <p class="h5">The Image Project lets you view your 'Before' and 'After' shots in a cool CSS slider. More importantly, it lets you view submissions from a community of other photographers so that you can get your daily dose of inspiration.</p>
        <p class="h5">This project arose from a desire to create something that combined my passion of design, development, and photography. If you are a veteran photographer or someone who just purchased a camera, I hope you can find a use for this website.</p>
